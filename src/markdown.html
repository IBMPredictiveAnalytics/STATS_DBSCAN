<h1>STATS DBSCAN Extension Command</h1>

<p>STATS DBSCAN /HELP prints this help and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>STATS DBSCAN VARIABLES = x y z RDIST = .5 MINPTS=5.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VARIABLES</strong> specifies the variables on which to cluster
the cases.  String variables are not permitted, and
categorical variables may be inappropriate for this
method.  Cases with any missing values are excluded listwise.</p>

<p><strong>RDIST</strong> specifies the reachability value.  That is the
maximum Euclidean distance a point can be from another point to
be included in its cluster.  Some experimentation may
be required to find a satisfactory value.  Points more than
this distance from every other point are considered noise.
Too small a value will make every point noise while too large
a value will result in most points being in the same cluster.
Standardizing the data may make it easier to pick this value.</p>

<p><strong>METHOD</strong> specifies the clustering method.  </p>

<ul>
<li>HYBRID is the default
and provides good speed with moderate memory usage.</li>
<li>RAW uses less memory but is likely to be slow.<br/></li>
<li>DIST clusters based on a distance matrix.  For DIST, the input variables
must constitute a distance matrix.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MINPTS</strong> specifies the minimum number of points to constitute
a cluster.  The default value is 5.  It is recommended that
the value be at least the number of variables plus 1.  A
value of 2 is equivalent to a certain hierarchical
clustering algorithm.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>SCALE</strong> = YES causes the variables to be standardized to zero
mean and unit variance.  This carries over to the prediction
process.</p>

<p><strong>SEEDS</strong> = YES specifies that seed information is included in
the cluster object.  This is required if predicting new cases,
and statistics are reported for both seeds and border points
in the output when this value is YES.</p>

<p><strong>MEMORYLIMIT</strong> specifies that the R memory limit should be
increased to the specified value, which is in megabytes.  Some
DBSCAN methods require large amounts of memory, so the default
value may need to be increased.</p>

<p>The maximum value depends on the operating system and R version.
On 32-bit Windows it is limited to 2 or 3GB.  On 64-bit Windows
using 64-bit R (and 64-bit Statistics), the limit is 8TB.  Once
the limit is set, it remains at that value for the remainder of
the session.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

<p><strong>PLOT</strong>=YES produces a plot of the points in the clusters.</p>

<h2>SAVE</h2>

<p>The SAVE parameters control saving of the cluster information.
Specify <strong>DSNAME</strong> as a dataset name not already in use to save
the cluster assignments in a new dataset.  You can specify
an <strong>ID</strong> variable to identify the cases.</p>

<p><strong>WORKSPACE</strong> specifies a file name for saving the R workspace.</p>

<p><strong>RETAIN</strong> = YES causes the workspace to be retained in memory.
Either a workspace file or the retained workspace can be used
to predict new cases using STATS DBPRED.</p>
